# FinalProject

The goal of this SPA is to provide an example of what Ive learned this semester in WDD3400. The page should provide both standard Covid directions as well as a imported dashboard from https://coronavirus.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/covid-19/dashboards/covid-19-vaccine/covid-19-vaccination-dashboard. This dashboard is live and and can be intereacted with just as on its original hosting site. Cookies are also demonstrated via a login with user and password fields that store the data and reload the page to great you using the values provided.
